### Introduction
Sentiment Analysis is used to identify and categorize opinions expressed in a text to determine the writer's attitude towards a particular topic. This script demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using Python and a suitable NLP library.

### Setup and Installation
To set up the environment for running the sentiment analysis script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codingTasks.git
cd codingTasks
```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use pip and a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts ctivate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Ensure you have the necessary NLP libraries installed, such as `nltk` or `textblob`.

### Usage
To use the sentiment analysis script, run the following command:
```
python sentiment_analysis.py <input_text>
```
Replace `<input_text>` with the text you want to analyze.

### Examples
Here are some example usages of the sentiment analysis script:

1. Analyzing a positive sentiment:
```
python sentiment_analysis.py "I love this product! It works great and exceeds my expectations."
```
Output:
```
Sentiment: Positive
```

2. Analyzing a negative sentiment:
```
python sentiment_analysis.py "I am very disappointed with this product. It did not work as advertised."
```
Output:
```
Sentiment: Negative
```
